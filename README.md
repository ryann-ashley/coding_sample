This script computes mixing diagrams (MD) from NU-WRF output to compare control, dry and wet soil simulations
during the 2012 drought. The objective is to compare how boundary layer moisture and temperature evolved in response to 
changing soil moisture to determine if land-atmosphere feedbacks played a role in drought evolution. 
Soil moisture perturbation simulations were performed by coupling NASA's NU-WRF to its Land Information Systems
(LIS) to obtain coupled simulations. 
 
Mixing diagrams are used to quantify the total change in the moisture and energy budget of the daytime 
boundary layer, and to estimate the relative contributions of surface fluxes and entrainment
to that evolution. The methodology is introduced in Santanello et al. (2009)

A new methodology using mixed layer mean values (instead of 2-m) to represent PBL evolution is introduced in this script as part
of a new methodology in preparation by Wakefield et al. (2021)
